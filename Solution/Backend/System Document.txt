Account Managemet Description

Created the system as a 2 part system.

1. where we have the customers that have been added into the system being able to 
just search for themselves, here the customer can edit or delete their information. 

2. Also where we having an administrator to the system being able to login and manage
customers performing standard CRUD functions.


With regards to the backend i used MVC to Create my APIs and then used part linq to communicate to my database.
The backend system runs on http://localhost:61656
NB: The connectionString can be found in the web.config and be modified accordingly when testing.

The passwords that i used for login in i had them encrypted so that when storing them they are not plainText.

With regards to the frontend i did not do much styling i just created a normal angular application for results which runs on http://localhost:4200.

Dummy login user (username:johndoe@mail.com, password: password);

With any further queries please contact me...

Raymond
